Hi! My name is Chad Bustard. I'm a data enthusiast and machine learning practicioner leveraging large-scale simulations,
 Python-based data analysis, and a start-up mindset to solve novel problems in astrophysics. I'm now adapting and 
 growing my skillset to tackle problems a bit closer to home, and I envision this blog as a medium for communicating new independent 
 projects, as well as some data-intensive work from my academic life. 

If you have any thoughts or comments on my work, please don't hesitate to contact me!
